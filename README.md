Phikila is a multi-school management platform for administrators, teachers, finance teams, admissions officers, secretaries, and parents. It provides role-based portals for managing students, staff, attendance, fees, admissions, exams, timetables, announcements, and notifications.

The application is available as a responsive web app and can also be packaged as a Progressive Web App, Android application, or desktop application.

## Highlights

- Role-based access for platform administrators, principals, teachers, finance teams, admissions officers, secretaries, and parents
- School, student, staff, class, subject, and academic-year management
- Attendance tracking with offline support and background synchronization
- Fees, student accounts, payments, admissions, announcements, and internal messaging
- Exams, grading, results analysis, and report workflows
- Timetable creation, printing, teacher assignments, and room management
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for school-scoped data access
- Google OAuth and Cloudflare Turnstile support
- Responsive PWA experience with Android and desktop packaging

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm
- A Supabase project
- A Google Cloud OAuth application for Google sign-in
- A Cloudflare Turnstile site and secret key

## Getting started

From the repository root:

```bash
cd phikila-app
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local` with values for your Supabase project, Google OAuth, and Cloudflare Turnstile configuration. The environment variable names and descriptions are documented in [`.env.local.example`](.env.local.example).

Apply the database migrations to your Supabase project:

```bash
npx supabase db push --project-ref <your-project-ref>
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For the complete Supabase, OAuth, first-school, and first-admin setup, see [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js development server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | Check TypeScript without emitting files |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build using the required Webpack pipeline |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build locally |
| `bash scripts/generate-icons.sh` | Regenerate PWA, favicon, Android, and Tauri icons |
| `bash scripts/build-android.sh` | Build the Android package |
| `bash scripts/build-desktop.sh` | Build the desktop package |

## Application areas

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Super admin | Manage schools, users, platform settings, and audit activity |
| Principal | Manage school operations, staff, students, academics, fees, exams, admissions, and timetables |

## Database migrations

Migrations are stored in [`supabase/migrations`](supabase/migrations) and should be applied in filename order. They define the schema, role types, timetable and exam features, self-registration, and RLS policies.

To link a local Supabase CLI project:

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
npx supabase db push
```

Do not commit `.env.local`, service-role keys, OAuth secrets, Turnstile secrets, signing keys, or other credentials.

## Building for Android

Android builds require an Android SDK and JDK 21. Set `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME`, then run:

```bash
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

If your local environment only has JDK 17, run the compatibility patch before building:

```bash
bash scripts/patch-capacitor-jdk17.sh
```

The patch must be reapplied after each `npx cap sync android`.

## Building for desktop

Install Rust and the platform dependencies, then run:

```bash
npx tauri build
```

Desktop artifacts are written under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Deployment

The web application is designed for Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

For a production deployment with the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

Configure all runtime environment variables in the Vercel project settings. Do not expose server-only values such as `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` or `SUPABASE_CAPTCHA_SECRET` to the browser.

## Contributing

1. Create a branch for your change.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build`.
4. Keep database changes in a new, ordered migration.
5. Open a pull request with a concise description and verification notes.

The project-specific development conventions are documented in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
