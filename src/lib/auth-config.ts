/**
 * Resolve the role a user should be treated as for a given school.
 *
 * Used after sign-in and in middleware/layouts so multi-school users are
 * gated and routed by the role in the school they selected (their active
 * school), rather than the first membership on their account.
 *
 * - `preferredRole` (e.g. the role chosen at the school picker) wins when the
 *   user still holds it in the active school.
 * - Otherwise the first role held in the active school is used.
 *
 * Returns undefined when there is no active school or the active school is no
 * longer an active membership — callers should then fall back to the user's
 * first membership.
